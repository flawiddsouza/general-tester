### Explantion

If you run this workflow without the fix from commit 707b7b2, you'll see that:

SetVariable - 1 shows:
```json
{
  "cat": "2"
}
```

SetVariable - 2 also shows:
```json
{
  "cat": "2"
}
```

The expected result:

SetVariable - 1:
```json
{
  "cat": "1"
}
```

SetVariable - 2:
```json
{
  "cat": "2"
}
```
